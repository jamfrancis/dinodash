# Development Environment

The development environment is called PICO-8, which is a game engine / virtual machine specifically built for retro-style game development. It has a built-in sprite editor, map editor, and is designed for very simple deployment.

The programming language used in PICO-8 is a modified version of Lua. Most of the functionality is included, although some features are stripped down. It includes some custom provided functions to interface with the graphics or input
